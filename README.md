# Tweetly

Super simple app that gathers latest post via RSS from
[my blog](https://chabik.com), shortens URL using my
[other super simple app](https://github.com/hadret/shorty) and posts it
altogether to my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/hadret). It leverages
SQLite for keeping track of what was published and
[Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org) for posting to Twitter.
